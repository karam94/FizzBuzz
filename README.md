# FizzBuzz

Mobbing session done during coding dojo at work to showcase Red, Green, Refactor cycles when performing TDD.
Feel free to send me any questions over Slack!

Note: There are different ways to implement this & different orders in which the cycles could be performed. Feel free to try it out yourself.
